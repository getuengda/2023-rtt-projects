		 * are times when you need to execute a block of code multiple times; often with
		 * variations in each execution. Programming languages provide flow-control
		 * structures that allow more complicated execution paths. Loop statements allow
		 * for executing a single statement or group of statements multiple times. A
		 * loop is typically controlled by an index or counter variable.
